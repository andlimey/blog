Hello. Welcome to my blog.

I’m Andy, a software engineer at Ascenda Loyalty.

I started this blog to journal my thoughts. I believe that writing forces you to think clearly, as you need to convey your thoughts and ideas concisely and coherently.

As to what I will write about, I’m still unsure. I will just take this opportunity to write whatever is occupying my mind. I realised that I tend to be able to string my thoughts better when I imagine myself explaining my thoughts to another person. Perhaps writing might be a more viable alternative. At the very least, this prevents me from looking self-absorbed or crazy when people see me mumbling or lost in thoughts.

To any reader out there who happen to chance upon my blog, I hope you will take away something from my writings.
