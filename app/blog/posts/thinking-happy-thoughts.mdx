In Dale Carnegie’s book “How to Win Friends and Influence People”, he talks about how a simple way to make a good first impression is your smile. He then gives countless examples of how a simple smile made the difference in people’s day-to-day interactions.

And, if you aren’t in the mood to smile, he also gives a suggestion – to force yourself to smile. Act as if you were already happy, and you’ll find yourself happier. According to the psychologist William James, action and feeling go hand-in-hand. By regulating the action, we can indirectly regulate the feeling. Hence, the solution to feeling happy, is to act and speak as if we were already happy.

Being a bit of a skeptic, I gave the recommendation a try. And to be honest, I would say it is effective. For context, I tend to be pessimistic about people. If I know I’m going to meet someone who I do not like as a person, I would sometimes conjure up scenarios where the person might disappoint me. By the time I meet the person, my mood would already be sour. However, when I tried acting as if I was already happy, I would focus on something that sparked joy, like thinking about a recent meetup with my group of friends. So even when I do meet someone I’m not particularly fond of, I do not feel an overwhelming sense of dread.

I think there is something beautiful about feeling happy just by thinking happy thoughts. I feel like I’ve just been so caught up in the rat race that I’ve forgotten how simple it is to be happy.
