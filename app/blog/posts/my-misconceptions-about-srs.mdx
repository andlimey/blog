The Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) is a voluntary scheme that we can tap on to save for our retirement[^1].

There are several benefits why we should utilise this tool to save for our retirement.

## Contributions are eligible for tax relief

For Singaporean Citizens, top-ups to our SRS is eligible for tax relief up to $15,300 per year.

Assuming you earn $80,000 per annum, and barring any other tax reliefs, you pay 15,300 \* 7% = $1,071 less in taxes based on the latest income tax rate for 2024[^2].

Imagine what you can do with that additional $1,071 saved!

## Only 50% of the withdrawals are taxable at retirement

There is no free lunch of course. While you enjoy tax savings now, you will be taxed later on when you make withdrawals during the eligible period.

However, only 50% of the withdrawals are taxable. This means if you withdraw $40,000, only $20,000 is taxable.

Based on the latest income tax rate, you won’t need to pay a single cent for that $40,000 withdrawal, since the income tax rate for the first $20,000 is 0%.

So not only do you defer your taxes now, you only need to pay 50% of the amount withdrawn later.

## If SRS is so good, why was I hesitant about utilising SRS?

I had 1 big misconception about SRS that stopped me from utilising it – which was that I needed to withdraw everything at the end of 10 years

A 10-year withdrawal period applies when you reach the statutory retirement age (depending on when you opened an account). This 10 year period only starts when you make your first withdrawal at or after the statutory retirement age when you made your first contribution to your SRS.

Initially, I thought that I would need to withdraw all my SRS funds at the end of the 10-year period, but this is incorrect. You can leave the balance in the SRS account.

However, if the SRS funds are not withdrawn completely, 50% of the balance remaining at the end of the 10 years will be subject to income tax[^3].

This changes things for me. Initially, I felt that the 10-year withdrawal window was confusing. If I were to include it in my retirement withdrawal strategy, be it the 4% rule[^4] or the bucketing system[^5], I would need to take into account this additional variable in my drawdown strategy.

What do I mean by this?

Let’s say I retire at 65. Ideally, my CPF LIFE payouts should cover most of my essential expenses. The other discrete expenses would then be covered by my other investments. Assuming I utilise SRS, at the end of 10 years, I would need to figure out what to do with the sum of money leftover. Furthermore, what if I had to liquidate them during a bear market? It was because of these 2 reasons that I was initially hesitant to use SRS.

However, now that I’ve cleared my misconceptions, there are still some considerations you need to account for if you are to use SRS. Specifically, you are still taxed at 50% of the amount you withdraw, so the withdrawal strategy matters.

Let’s say you have a total of $960,000 in your SRS account, and you withdraw $960,000/12 = $80,000 per year for 10 years. Based on the current income tax rate for YA2024 onwards, you will need to pay $550 in taxes. Over 10 years, you will need to pay $5,550.

Now, let’s say you withdraw $40,000 for the first 9 years, you do not need to pay any taxes since $20,000 is taxable and the tax rate is 0% for that bracket. However, the remaining 600,000 you withdraw in the final year will incur a hefty tax, since the tax rate goes up as the income rises.

In the above 2 scenarios, it is better to just withdraw evenly over the 10 years. But what if you do not need to withdraw such an amount? Assuming you only need $5,000 per month to live comfortably, and that your CPF LIFE payouts will cover $1,000 of that $5,000, withdrawing 80,000/12 = 6666.67 per month is unnecessary. However, if you don’t withdraw ‘properly’, you are going to incur a hefty tax at the end of the 10 years, even if only 50% if taxable.

## Concluding Thoughts

Overall, I think the SRS is still a good tool that allows you to supplement your retirement and save on taxes in the present moment. But I am still uncertain about the drawdown strategy, and for that reason, I will probably not max out my SRS contributions yet, not until I find out more.
