We bought our maternity insurance for Micah the moment we were able to, which was when my wife was 13 weeks pregnant.

Here's a rundown of what maternity insurance is and why we bought it.

### What is maternity insurance

From this article by MoneySmart: Maternity insurance is often a single-premium insurance which complements your medical insurance. It is specially designed to offer a lump-sum payout or daily hospital allowance in the event of pregnancy complications, or when your newborn gets diagnosed with any congenital illness[^1].

Some insurance companies also bundle the maternity insurance with a whole-life plan or ILP. To my knowledge, some give the option for the mother to transfer the coverage to the baby when the baby is born.

There are also plans that covers the baby under a hospital plan for free for the first year. One such plan is the HSBC Life HappyMummy[^2].

> You can apply for an HSBC Life Shield Plan B cover for your newborn within 60 days of birth, and we'll waive premiums for the first year. To get started, you'll need to successfully apply for an HSBC Life EmpoweredMum plan, and either [HSBC Life Flexi Protector](https://www.insurance.hsbc.com.sg/investment/products/flexi-protector/) or [HSBC Life – Life Treasure III](https://www.insurance.hsbc.com.sg/life-and-critical-illness/products/life-treasure-iii/).

### Why did we buy a maternity insurance plan?

**Reason 1: Provides us with a buffer in case any complications happen**

To be fair, MediShield Life does cover 24 pregnancy-related conditions[^3]. So it is not strictly necessary to purchase a maternity insurance plan. However, it provides an additional buffer.

**Reason 2: Coverage against pre-existing conditions**

This is the main reason why we purchased a maternity insurance plan, specifically the [AIA Mum2Baby Protect](https://www.aia.com.sg/en/our-products/health/medical-insurance/aia-mum2baby-choices) that includes a whole-life plan. As mentioned, some plans give the option for mothers to transfer the coverage to the baby when the baby is born.

There are 2 main impacts of a medical crisis for newborns:

1. Medical expenses
2. Loss of income for parents (due to caregiving needs)

We added a critical illness rider on top of our maternity insurance. Having this rider allows us to buffer against large medical bills, or pay for alternative treatment.

It also gives us the option to take a leave of absence from work if needed to care for our child.

So, while we hope that nothing will happen to Micah, purchasing the maternity insurance gave us a better peace of mind for the rest of the pregnancy journey.
