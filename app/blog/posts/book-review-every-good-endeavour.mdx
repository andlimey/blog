In “Every Good Endeavour”, Tim Keller delves into how biblical wisdom is relevant to our questions about work. How should we view work in the context of the Bible? This is especially relevant in a secular working environment – not every one of us works in the church ministry.

How can we connect the work we do to God especially if they seem distant from each other?

## The Design of Work

From the beginning, the Bible already talks about work. In Genesis, God worked to create the earth, and He finds delight in the work He did after forming the earth. When Adam and Eve were formed, they worked in the garden as gardeners.

From the very beginning, work is a part of God’s design. It is as much a basic human need as food and rest.

It is important to note that God also rested (even though He probably didn’t need to). While work is important, it is not what defines us. We also need to enjoy other aspects of our lives.

## The Dignity of Work

There are many different types of jobs out there. To the Greeks, work was a barrier to the highest kind of life. They believed that work that used the mind was something to be admired.

However, we know from beginning of the Bible that work is a crucial part of our lives. Only Adam and Even was given work, and frankly it was manual labour. However, God’s own work in Genesis 1 and 2 is something of manual labour – he formed the world and shaped us out of dust. He probably could have snapped His fingers and made everything as they were, but He did things methodically. On top of that, we also know that Jesus Himself was a carpenter. It was not something that was glamorous.

What can we learn from this? That work has dignity no matter what profession we are in because it is something God does.

## Work as Service

How then can we relate our work to God? Keller shows how the New Testament gives some answers to this.

In 1 Corinthians 7, Paul counsels the corinthian church that when we become Christians, it is unnecessary to change what we are currently doing in life in order to live lives before God that is pleasing to Him.

Just as God equips Christians for building up the Body of Christ, we are also equipped with talents and gifts for various other kinds of work.

Also, remember that we are commanded to love our neighbour. Our work is a way of service to God and our neighbours.

This was something that I initially struggled with. I was not sure how certain sectors like E-commerce or Banking and Finance is something that serves others. But actually they can be. For instance, in the context of banking and finance, one of their role is to loan to businesses. Without this function, it would be difficult for these businesses to do what they need without the capital.

## Concluding Thoughts

I think the problem with work is that it is marred with sin. In an ideal world, each of our work has a clear benefit and function. However, due to sins like greed and selfishness, we corrupt our work. We need only reference the various financial crisis to highlight this point.

I found the book to be insightful, especially as a christian in a secular working environment. But even if you’re not christian, I think it still offers a different perspective into how you can view the various kinds of work.

Work is a huge and essential part of our lives, but it also isn’t everything.
