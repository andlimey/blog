I found out that Timothy Keller recently passed away at the age of 72 after a battle with pancreatic cancer.

According to [Wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Keller_(pastor)>), Timothy James Keller was an American pastor, theologian, and Christian apologist. But I knew of him primarily from 2 of his books that I’ve read – [The Meaning of Marriage](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/11389341) and [Counterfeit Gods](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6403690-counterfeit-gods?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_16). Both of which were helpful to me in my married life and Christian walk.

A few days ago, I read the [tweet](https://twitter.com/x/migrate?tok=7b2265223a222f74696d6b656c6c65726e79632f7374617475732f31363539333134313235353737353638323632222c2274223a313731393231323736387d9049241d04d485bd9dfd1fe062666e97) posted by his son:

> Health Update: Today, Dad is being discharged from the hospital to receive hospice care at home. Over the past few days, he has asked us to pray with him often. He expressed many times through prayer his desire to go home to be with Jesus. His family is very sad because we all wanted more time, but we know he has very little at this point. In prayer, he said two nights ago, “I’m thankful for all the people who’ve prayed for me over the years. I’m thankful for my family, that loves me. I’m thankful for the time God has given me, but I’m ready to see Jesus. I can’t wait to see Jesus. Send me home.

Coincidentally, I recently chanced upon an [article](https://www.youngmoney.co/p/living-life-backwards) talking about the case for living life backwards. The author posits that we ought to begin with the end in mind, asking ourselves what we aspire to be and do before we are willing to pass on.

By beginning with the end in mind, we are empowered to live fully in the present. By defining our goals and our values, it helps us decide what choices we should or shouldn’t make in a life filled with uncertainty.

Warren Buffett echoed a similar sentiment when asked what was the key to living a good life. He suggested: _“You should write your obituary, and then try to figure out how to live up to it.”_.

Similarly, Jeff Bezos left his hedge fund job to start Amazon because he wanted to minimize his regrets when he looks back on his life.

**Why am I saying all these?**

I feel sad knowing that Timothy Keller has passed on, yet it fills me with comfort knowing that he was surrounded by people who love him, that he was ready to go back home.

I feel sad knowing that Timothy Keller has passed on, yet it fills me with comfort knowing that he was surrounded by people who love him, that he was ready to go back home.

And this makes me reflect about my own life.

- How am I using my gifts to honour and glorify God?
- How is my relationship with Jesus?
- How am I cherishing what I have now?
- How is my relationship with my friends and family?
- What are my goals in life?
- What are the values guiding my life decisions?

These are difficult questions to answer. I would like to think I am trying my best to live a life that is pleasing to God, instead of chasing after counterfeit gods like money, status and fame.

It has not been easy though. For instance, I gave up an additional 20k/year of income to go into public service because I believed in the work the team was doing. And I am unsure if I even want to leave the public service. This is contrary to social norms where you ought to job hop to earn more money and gain exposure in different companies.

My hope is that at the end of the day, when I return back home, I would be surrounded by the people I love, where I can look back on my life knowing that I have lived my life the best I could, doing what I believe is meaningful, and also enjoying the moment.

It will not be an easy journey, but I pray that God will continue to guide me.
