summary: "Life Update -  Expecting our first child"

As of writing, my wife is 18 weeks pregnant. It has been an incredible journey so far.

We found out when she was just a few weeks pregnant, and we were both shocked. It took us a few days to process the news.

I am not able to explain the mix of emotions I felt during the early weeks. However, for the most part, I felt anxious.

Anxious because I didn't know what to expect.

Anxious because I was afraid of the many things that could happen to our child.

The early stages of the pregnancy can be volatile. It is also why people do not typically announce their pregnancies until after the first trimester, where things are more stabilized. This created some distress for my wife, who wanted but could not explain why she felt extremely tired and lethargic.

The anxiety didn't get better as we inched closer to the 12th week mark, because we were scheduled for a noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) test, to test for risks of down syndrome. And although the risks are low, you can't help but wonder what you both would do if it ever happens.

Personally, things got better for me after I went for a church camp around the same time. Part of the program involved a time of silence and solitude. We were given a passage to meditate on for 2 hours, and the particular passage spoke to me. It was Mark 4:35-41.

> **Jesus Calms the Storm**
> 35 That day when evening came, he said to his disciples, “Let us go over to the other side.” 36 Leaving the crowd behind, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat. There were also other boats with him. 37 A furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat, so that it was nearly swamped. 38 Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. The disciples woke him and said to him, “Teacher, don’t you care if we drown?”
> 39 He got up, rebuked the wind and said to the waves, “Quiet! Be still!” Then the wind died down and it was completely calm.
> 40 He said to his disciples, “Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?”
> 41 They were terrified and asked each other, “Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!”

Here, even though Jesus seemed to be doing nothing at the stern, He had already promised the disciples that they will cross to the other side. Yet, the disciples were afraid.

Similarly, my anxiety had made me forgotten that prior to finding out that Sophia is pregnant, we prayed and committed the process to God. With our prayers answered, why do I continue to fear? Do I not have faith that He will see us through this process?

I felt reassured after coming back from the church camp. There are still moments where I feel anxious. It is definitely not an easy process.

However, when I feel like either of us are about to be overwhelmed, I ask to pray together, to surrender our worries and commit the process to God.

A wonderful new phase is about to begin, and although it will be challenging, we have no need to fear.
