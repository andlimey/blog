It's the first week of 2025. I thought it might be a good time to reflect on 2024 before another year zooms past.

The past year has been eventful in several ways for me.

### Career

At the start of 2024, I was struggling to decide if I should leave GovTech. I already had several offers then, so I was deciding if I should accept those offers.

On one hand, I felt that what I was doing in GovTech was meaningful. On the other, I didn't feel that I was growing as fast as I wanted to, and I also wanted to try working in the private sector.

After thinking about it for a few days, I decided to take the leap and join Ascenda.

The loyalty program space was something that interests me, being a miles chaser myself. I also felt that I could grow more as a software engineer there. This made me anxious at first, because I wasn't sure if I was 'good enough' to work in the private sector. To some extent, I felt sheltered and safe working in GovTech given the stability.

However, I decided not to let these worries consume me, and focused on doing what I could and learning as much as I can.

So far, I've enjoyed myself at Ascenda, and am amazed at how much I've learned since I joined.

### Fitness

2024 was the year I decided to start doing proper strength exercises. My workouts mainly consisted of Tabata[^1] and running at least once a week. But I felt that it wasn't enough to build muscle.

After 30 years old, you'll start to lose muscle at a faster rate[^2]. So I felt that it was important to start doing strength and resistance training.

However, I had no idea how to start since I never lifted any weights before. So I decided to go for Body Fit Training (BFT) using Classpass. Honestly, it is fun to exercise with people.

In the future, I might eventually go to the gym myself, but for now, BFT will suffice.

I also decided to run a half marathon for the 2nd time. The first time I ran was in 2016, where I was 'volunteered' to run the Army Half Marathon. But I wanted to run 1 voluntarily, and while I am still relatively fit.

I signed up for the Standard Chartered Marathon held in December 2024. I started training in August for the half marathon.

The weeks leading up to the half marathon was difficult. I was supposed to run at least 3-4 times per week. I had to do:

- 1 long run (the longest I did was 18km before the actual race)
- 1 speed training
- easy/recovery runs

Apart from the physical exhaustion, I was also mentally drained. The training in October was the worst since it was when I had to clock my highest mileage. Each long-distance run was at least 10km long and took me at least an hour. It was very time-consuming.

I was relieved when I finally finished the race. I wanted to finish in 2h30min, but ended up taking 2h50min. It was not the timing I wanted, but I think it was still a feat that I trained for it, and finished the race. It will probably be my last half marathon for a long while.

I'm looking to do Hyrox next though.

### Holidays

I was fortunate enough to travel a lot in 2024, and to several different places.

In April-May, I went to Croatia and Slovenia with my wife's ex-Shopee colleagues. There were 10 of us in total.

In July, I went to Jakarta with Sophia. She had to be there for work, and I flew over the weekend to spend time with her.

In August, we went to Bangkok with Joy and Nigel

In November, we went to visit Deanna, Waihan and Raymond in Melbourne with Keyun and Yuheng.

In December, we went to Hanoi with Sophia's family.

Unfortunately, I don't think we will be able to travel that often in 2025.

### Mens' Ministry

My church has a mens' ministry where we gather about once a month. I was asked to be a facilitator for the younger men in 2024.

It was particularly challenging, but I hope that the men I facilitated have had a positive experience so far.

### Major life update

And of course, not forgetting that 2024 was the year my wife got pregnant. I'm thankful to God for blessing us with a kid.

Personally, I feel blessed by the journey so far. It has drawn us closer together as a couple. We've been reading [Gospel-Centered Family](https://www.amazon.sg/Gospel-Centered-Family-Becoming-parents/dp/1908317078) together as part of our quiet time. And we've been praying together more often.

I can see why becoming a parent enriches your understanding of God's love for us. Even though Micah isn't born yet, we already feel so much love for him.

My hope is that we can strive to show Micah God's love for him through us.

### Looking ahead

A lot of changes will be happening in 2025. I will undoubtedly struggle as a first-time parent, but I ultimately look forward to this wonderful experience.
