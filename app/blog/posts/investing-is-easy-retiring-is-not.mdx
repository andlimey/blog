## Why Investing is Easy

I started investing when I was 18. My first investment was an 8-year endowment plan. When I entered university, I stumbled upon the[ DBS Invest-Saver](https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/investments/other-investments/invest-saver) plan which exposed me to the concept of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).

Subsequently, I learned about stocks, bonds, unit trusts, REITs, and so on. It was intimidating at first. But I eventually realised that, if you’re investing to get rich, you probably don’t need to know about every investment out there. For most of us, it is probably sufficient to invest in a low-cost globally diversified fund.

Why low cost? Because high fees eat into your returns.

Why globally diversified? A globally diversified index fund allows you to spread your investments across a wide range of assets, reducing the impact of individual stock or sector performance on your portfolio.

It is so that you are hedged against risks such as [idiosyncratic risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/idiosyncraticrisk.asp) and [concentration risk](https://www.mathworks.com/discovery/concentration-risk.html). It is true that if you pick winning stocks, you can potentially yield higher returns, but whether we are able to identify such companies is a different matter. And there are plenty of examples that show how only a small percentage of companies account for most of the returns in the market [^1].

Do we have the time and skill to identify these companies? For most of us, probably not. By investing in the entire market rather than trying to beat it, you eliminate the need for extensive research or expertise.

## Why I think retirement is more challenging

So yes, after reading up about investments for the past few years, I am of the opinion that investing to accumulate wealth is relatively straightforward. Retirement, however, presents a whole different set of challenges.

There are a few key risks when it comes to retirement [^2].

### 1. Longevity Risk: The risk of outliving your investments

As life expectancy continues to increase, outliving your savings becomes a real possibility, and it requires careful planning to ensure your money lasts as long as you do.

You need to put thought in how you might be able to balance between a comfortable retirement lifestyle and the need to stretch your savings.

### 2. Sequence of Returns Risk: The risk where the timing of withdrawals during a bear market can adversely affect your portfolio

The sequence in which you draw down your investments can have an adverse impact on the sustainability of your retirement savings.

A period of poor market performance early in retirement can deplete your portfolio faster than anticipated, making it harder to recover. How might you handle this scenario when it happens?

### 3. Inflation Risk and Healthcare Risk

These are more self-explanatory. As the cost of living and healthcare costs rises, you risk not being able to cope with the higher expenses. This is especially the case for healthcare costs as you are more prone to falling ill when you’re older.

## Concluding Thoughts

In the first place, how can you determine how much you need in retirement? You can certainly use a rule of thumb like the 4% rule [^3], but there are still so many factors to consider.

- How might your expenses change years down the road?
- What if your concept of retirement is to take a paycut to explore another job that you’re more passionate about?
- How does CPF LIFE come into play here?

Retirement planning is something that both confounds and intrigues me. There are so many considerations to account for, yet there is probably no one solution for everyone since everyone’s situation is unique. And we probably have our own definition of ‘retirement’. Perhaps here is when a financial advisor might be useful, in helping us to plan for our retirement, charting a course ahead.
