summary: "I used the wrong credit cards for my wedding"
---

I got married in August 2022. Back then, I didn’t know much about credit cards or anything about playing the miles game. Instead, I opted for cashback credit cards.

**Why did I suddenly come to the realisation that I used the wrong credit cards?**

I recently came back from Japan with my wife. My mother-in-law kindly redeemed her miles for us, so we did not spend a single cent on the flight tickets.

Best of all, she redeemed business-class tickets for the flight back to Singapore. That was my first business-class experience and I can see the appeal now. I probably would not pay for a business-class ticket, but I think I will try to play the miles game to travel better for less.

## What credit cards did I use for my wedding?

Before I delve into that, one thing to note is that not many vendors accept credit cards. For example, the florists, videographers, and photographers only accepted PayNow. So for simplicity, I’ll only use the wedding banquet cost as an example, since it will form the bulk of the total wedding cost anyway.

The total cost of the banquet came up to be roughly $61,000, but let’s just use $60,000. On a separate note, when I was speaking to different hotels, some did not allow you to split the payments into instalments. Instead, you could only split the total payments a limited number of times, which I thought was odd and inflexible. This is something you should clarify with the hotel coordinators.

For my wedding, I only needed to pay a $10,000 deposit, and finish paying the remaining amount a few weeks before the wedding. This means I was able to pay in instalments per month. The following table shows the credit cards we used.

| Credit Card           | Card Detail                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Citi Cashback+        | At that point, there was a $350 sign-up bonus if we spent $5,000. Otherwise, this gives 1.6% cashback on eligible spend                                                    |
| UOB One               | At that point, the UOB One gave 5% cashback on all eligible spend if you spend a minimum of $2,000 instead of the current 3.33%. So that gives a minimum of $100 per month |
| UOB Absolute Cashback | 1.7% on all spend                                                                                                                                                          |

My wife and I both got the Citi Cashback+ card and UOB One card each. This is how much cashback we earned:

| Amount Spent                                                        | Card Used              | Cashback                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| First $10,000 deposit                                               | Citi Cashback+         | $350 + $350 + (1.6% \* $10,000) = $860 |
| Subsequent $38,000 in instalments                                   | UOB One                | $100 \* ($38,000 / $2,000) = $1,900    |
| Final $12,000 <br /> \*This was nearing the deadline to the wedding | UOB Absolute Cashback+ | $12,000 \* 1.7% = $204                 |

The total cashback we received came up to be $860 + $1,900 + $204 = $2,964

That’s slightly more than the cost of a single table at our wedding venue, which is not too bad. But let’s see how different it would be if we optimised for miles.

## Optimising for Miles

The MileLion wrote an article on the best credit cards to use for weddings. It can be found [here](https://milelion.com/2023/06/08/best-credit-cards-for-weddings/). Looking back, I probably would have used the following cards if I wanted to optimise for miles.

| Credit Card        | Card Detail                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| UOB Visa Signature | 4 mpd on contactless spend. Cap is $2,000 per statement month                                                                      |
| Citi Premier Miles | 1.2 mpd on local spend Sign-up bonus: Spend $800 in the first 2 months and pay the first year’s annual fee to receive 30,960 miles |

A caveat is that I can’t recall the sign-up bonuses during that time. So I am referring to the sign-up bonuses as of 29 April 2023.

The miles we could have earned would be:

| Amount Spent                      | Card Used          | Miles                                       |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| First $10,000 deposit             | Citi Premier Miles | 30,960 + 30,960 + (1.2 \* $10,000) = 73,920 |
| Subsequent $38,000 in instalments | UOB Visa Signature | $38,000 \* 4 = 152,000                      |
| Final $12,000                     | Citi Premier Miles | $12,000 \* 1.2 = 14,400                     |

In total, the number of miles we could have earned is 73,920 + 152,000 + 14,400 = 240,320 miles

For context, it costs about 104,000 miles – 140,000 miles for a business-class ticket to-and-fro Tokyo[^1].

It is definitely more value-for-money if we had optimised for miles.

## Concluding Thoughts

Looking at the actual numbers, I do have some regrets over not using miles cards for my wedding. However, hindsight is 20:20, and we made the best decision at that point in time given our limited knowledge about the miles game.

I’m moving away from cashback and have recently started using miles cards like the HSBC Revolution and the UOB One Preferred Platinum card. I’m still new to the game, but I’m excited to redeem my first business-class ticket.
