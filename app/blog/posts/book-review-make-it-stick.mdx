summary: "Book Review: Make It Stick"

Having gone through a rather rigorous education system, I’ve heard my fair share of advice when it comes to studying. Some notable ones include:

1. Highlight important points
2. Practice. Practice. Practice. Don’t forget to do your Ten year series
3. Create a mind map of ideas

I thought that after graduating into the working world, there would be no need for such studying methods. After all, how do we even practice the equivalent of a ten year series in the working world?

But I was wrong. In fact, as an engineer, you literally have to learn many different things, otherwise you will be made redundant. That drew me to this book, and it did not disappoint.

## Most of the advice you hear about studying is wrong

The book posits that learning is deeper and more durable when it is **effortful**. Hence, most of what the book recommends is centered around the principles of retrieval learning.

Some examples of retrieval learning include:

- Quizzing and self-testing
- Spacing out your practice
- Trying to solve the problem before being taught the solution

The main idea is that effortful retrieval makes for stronger learning and retention. For example, when we try to recall concepts for a quiz, we strengthen our memory on that topic. In fact, spacing out practice works because some forgetting has happened during that period, and it becomes harder to recall the concepts you have just learned.

This goes against the advice that we have been used to hearing, and it may feel counter-intuitive if we try it for ourselves. This is because it can feel unproductive when we struggle to recall a concept for a quiz or practice paper.

In contrast, we would feel much more productive if we do practice paper after practice paper on a topic we have just studied. But this is actually the least productive. Rapid-fire practice (especially after reading about the concepts) relies on short-term memory. It gives the illusion of knowledge, but it does not commit the knowledge to long-term memory.

Instead, embrace the impediments. The more effort required for recalling, the better we learn it.

Other ways of practicing effortful recalls include reflecting on the concept, because it involves recalling what we have just learned, elaborating in our own words, and connecting the different ideas and concepts together.

## Why is this important though?

Initially, I thought why would this be important? It just sounds like rote memorization to me. But this was addressed early on in the book:

1. Learning requires memory to be useful, so that what we learned is till there later when we need it
2. We need to keep learning and remembering all our lives. Getting ahead requires mastery of different skills. If you’re good at learning, you’ll be adept in life
3. Learning is an acquired skill

Indeed, the synthesis of ideas is conditioned on us first knowing the foundations that undergird those ideas. Having read this book, perhaps it is time to ditch away the traditional ways of learning, and take the effort to make our learning stick.
