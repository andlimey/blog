summary: "Rebuilding my blog in NextJS"

This isn't actually my first blog.

Before this, I used Wordpress as it did everything out-of-the-box, such as providing analytics and themes. I was also able to download Jetpack from the Play Store and blog from my phone.

Before that, I used [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). And before Hugo, I used [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/).

But, my manager at Ascenda suggested I build my blog as a way to learn. It was a good idea, although how I did it is perhaps, questionable.

I was torn between using a template vs really building it from scratch.

Considering that I look at code all day, the last thing I want to do in my free time is look at and write more code. I also wanted to complete this within a few months.

So I used NextJS' starter portfolio but customised it as my own. And I'm not shying away from this - clicking on View Original Source opens a new tab to the original starter kit.

### What Came With The Starter Kit?

The Starter Kit came with the following:

- MDX and Markdown support
- Optimized for SEO (sitemap, robots, JSON-LD schema)
- RSS Feed
- Tailwind
- Vercel Speed Insights / Web Analytics

As you can see, most of the groundwork is done already. I've also decided to deploy it using Vercel out of simplicity first.

I've read that it is notoriously difficult to deploy NextJS without using Vercel.

I have yet to verify this. But since it provides web analytics and speed insights out-of-the-box, I decided to use it.

### Customisations

**Support for dark theme**

I added support for dark theme using [next-themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes).

**Support for GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)**

Then, I added support for GFM using [remark-gfm](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm). I needed this as I had tables in 1 of my posts.

**Miscellaneous**

The other modifications are mostly stylistic. I made some minor CSS adjustments.

### Moving Forward

The blog is still far from complete. I plan to implement the following:

**1. Pagination**

So that readers do not need to scroll endlessly. I doubt I will reach there so fast, but it seems like good practice to try to implement it myself anyway.

**2. Tags**

As you can see, I don't write exclusively about software engineering.

It would be good to attach tags to the .mdx files as part of the metadata so readers can filter the posts by topics.

**3. Add support for images**
I currently do not have images in any of my post, but the current codebase does not support it.

Fortunately, this can easily be done using another plugin.

**4. Read the files from a CMS**

Currently, all my content is housed in the `/blog/posts/` directory.

But what if I want to read from an external database like Notion or Google Drive?

### Concluding Thoughts

I initially struggled to start on this because I wanted it to be 'perfect'. i.e. Write everything from scratch and deploy by myself.

However, this resulted in analysis paralysis. I couldn't decide on which tech stack to use.

- Should I use NextJS or use a static site generator?
- Should I use a CMS or read the content from a local directory?
- How should I style the website?

In the end, I decided to fight against my imposter syndrome and use a starter kit to get things going.

I decided that it shouldn't matter to me if using a starter kit makes me look like an inferior software engineer. As long as I am still learning, it is a step forward.

I hope this post inspires other engineers who feel the same way.
